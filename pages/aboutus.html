      <b>The Museum of __, where the artist fills the blank. </b>

      The museum was created in 2004, to showcase a unique characteristic of the mind: to find beauty in everything.


      Creators, Una and Michael Hughes wanted to create a space for everything. A speace for any artist to
      showcase what inspires them. As kids growing up in New York, they learned of the beauty that comes from 
      living in a concrete jungle and that artificial lights that illumniate the sky.

      They set off on a mission to elevate their view. To travel and see rural areas, abandoned places, the misfits, 
      the high class and the mysterious. However, viewing the world from only their perspective became a thing of 
      the past and they looked forward to see what others thought of it.

      As so, they have invited artists from all over the world to share their unique perspectives. 

      <em>What is beauty? What is grotesque or avant-garde?
      Who chooses and who decides?</em>


      <b>YOU DO. So show us your unique view. </b>
